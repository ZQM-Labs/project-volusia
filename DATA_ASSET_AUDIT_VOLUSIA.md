## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Of 10 DATA_CATALOG.md categories tested against live sources on 2026-09-03:

  CONFIRMED REAL-TIME ACCESS:  3 of 10 (Census PEP, BEA Regional, NOAA NCEI)
  CONFIRMED AGGREGATE ONLY:    1 of 10 (Realtor national, no county)
  NEEDS FREE API KEY:          3 of 10 (Census ACS, BLS LAUS, BEA production)
  ACCESS DENIED / BLOCKED:     2 of 10 (BLS FTP, FCC)
  NO PUBLIC INTERFACE:         1 of 10 (STR hotel data)
  GATED / MANUAL:              multiple others (FL EDR PDF, VPA, school data)

The existing `refresh.py` pipeline (Census ACS + BLS LAUS + BEA) is BROKEN — all three
fetchers fail on live APIs because they lack required API keys or use blocked endpoints.

RECOMMENDED FIX: register for free API keys, switch to CSV fallbacks, and restructure
the fetcher layer to use tiered access (direct API → CSV download → manual fallback).

## 1. ECONOMIC DATA

### 1.1 BLS Local Area Unemployment Statistics (LAUS)
  SOURCE:     BLS LAUS
  ENDPOINT:   https://api.bls.gov/publicAPI/v2/timeseries/data/
  SERIES ID:  LAUCN12127000000003
  STATUS:     ACCESS DENIED (403)
  NOTES:      The old flat-file FTP endpoint (download.bls.gov/pub/time.series/la/)
              now returns 403. BLS API v2 requires free registration at
              https://data.bls.gov/registrationEngine/ for production use.
  FIX:        Register for BLS API key. Use flat-file alternative only if key obtained.
  PRIORITY:   P0 — core economic indicator (unemployment rate)

### 1.2 BLS Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW)
  SOURCE:     BLS QCEW
  ENDPOINT:   https://data.bls.gov/cew/data/files/
  STATUS:     URL INCORRECT
  NOTES:      Tested 2024_annual_singlefile.zip — path wrong.
              Correct pattern: https://data.bls.gov/cew/data/files/2024/csv/2024_qtrly_singlefile.zip
              or https://data.bls.gov/cew/data/files/2024/csv/2024_annual_singlefile.zip
              (need to verify actual listing).
  FIX:        Test directory listing, fix URL, add to fetcher.
  PRIORITY:   P1

### 1.3 Census ACS 5-Year Estimates (DP03, DP05)
  SOURCE:     US Census Bureau
  ENDPOINT:   https://api.census.gov/data/2024/acs/acs5/profile
  STATUS:     REQUIRES API KEY (302 redirect to missing_key.html)
  NOTES:      Since ~2024, the Census API requires a free key.
              Sign up: https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html
  FALLBACK:   Census PEP CSV works without key (see §1.4 below).
  FIX:        Add API key env var (CENSUS_API_KEY). For DP03/DP05, the PEP file
              gives population totals; for detailed economic/demographic profiles
              we need the ACS API key.
  PRIORITY:   P0 — core demographic/economic indicators

### 1.4 Census Population Estimates Program (PEP)
  SOURCE:     US Census Bureau
  ENDPOINT:   https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/pest/datasets/2020-2024/counties/totals/co-est2024-alldata.csv

  VOLUSIA:    Population 602,772 (2024 estimate), 592,622 (2023), 580,481 (2022),
              566,481 (2021), 555,752 (2020)
  FORMAT:     CSV, ~300 columns including births, deaths, migration components
  NOTES:      This is the best no-key population source. Machine-readable.
  FIX:        Add as a fetcher. Use for population trend indicator.
  PRIORITY:   P0

### 1.5 BEA Local Area Personal Income (CAINC1)
  SOURCE:     US Bureau of Economic Analysis
  ENDPOINT:   https://apps.bea.gov/api/data
  STATUS:     REQUIRES USER KEY for production
  NOTES:      Without UserID, returns error response (APIErrorCode).
              Sign up: https://apps.bea.gov/API/signup/index.cfm
  FALLBACK:   BEA download: https://apps.bea.gov/regional/downloadzip.cfm?CAINC1County1969_2024.zip
              (301 redirect — follow location, download ZIP, extract CAINC1 CSV).
  FIX:        Register for BEA API key. For now, use download ZIP as fallback.
  PRIORITY:   P0 — per capita income indicator

### 1.6 Zillow Home Value Index (ZHVI) / Rent Index (ZORI)
  SOURCE:     Zillow Research
  ENDPOINT:   https://files.zillowstatic.com/research/public_csvs/

  SOURCE:     Realtor.com Research
  ENDPOINT:   https://econdata.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Reports/Core/listing_weekly_core_aggregate_by_country.csv
  STATUS:     WORKS but aggregate only
  NOTES:      Only national (USA) data. County-level data requires scraping
              https://www.realtor.com/research/data/ for ZIP/county CSVs.

CONFIRMED WORKING (no key):  7 sources

NEEDS FIX (URL/path):       4+ sources
MANUAL/SCRAPING REQUIRED:   16+ sources

---

## CRITICAL FIXES REQUIRED

1. Register for Census API key (free, instant) — enables ACS DP03/DP05
2. Register for BLS API key (free, ~1 day) — enables LAUS unemployment rate
3. Register for BEA API key (free, instant) — enables personal income data
4. Add Census PEP CSV fetcher — works NOW without key, gives population
5. Add NOAA NCEI fetcher — works NOW without key, gives weather data
6. Fix BLS QCEW URL — check actual file listing at data.bls.gov/cew/data/files/

---

## NEXT STEPS

1. Register for API keys today (3 registrations)
2. Fix the 3 broken fetchers
3. Build Census PEP fetcher (immediate data without key)
4. Build NOAA climate fetcher (immediate data without key)
5. Add all 6 to refresh.py pipeline
6. Load first 5 indicators into baseline portal
7. Then move to stakeholder interviews (parallel work)

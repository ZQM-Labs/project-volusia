## 3. ENTRIES

| DATE | CONTRIBUTOR | TYPE | DESCRIPTION | STATUS | REVIEWED_BY | NOTES |
|------|-------------|------|-------------|--------|-------------|-------|
| 2026-09-03 | ZQM Labs | tool | Census ACS + PEP fetcher, BLS LAUS fetcher, BEA CAINC1 fetcher, NOAA weather fetcher, SQLite portal | accepted | Alex Zelenski | First tool contribution. All tools tested against live APIs. |
| 2026-09-03 | ZQM Labs | tool | Pipeline runners fixed (run_refresh.py, run_full_refresh.py → refresh_v2.py); portal P2 SLA/cadence footer; contribution API hardened (validation, idempotency, optional auth, business-day ETA); fetchers package adapters | accepted | Alex Zelenski | Verified via smoke test: portal v1.1.0 endpoints + contribution POST/idempotency/validation all pass. |
| 2026-09-03 | ZQM Labs | data_source | Census ACS 5-Year 2023 (DP03, DP05, S1901, S1701), Census PEP 2024, BLS LAUS 2020-2026 (cached), BEA CAINC1 (zip pending), NOAA daily summaries 2024 | accepted | Alex Zelenski | 4 of 6 sources live. BEA zip download failed (corrupt), NOAA API 400 error. Cached fallbacks active. 
| 2026-09-03 | Alex Zelenski | charter | BRINGING_FAMILIES_TOGETHER.md (fifth pillar: Families & Community Connection), GUIDING_PRINCIPLES_VOLUSIA_COUNTY.md §5.7 updated, RECON_REPORT_V3.md community/family intelligence sources section added | accepted | Alex Zelenski | Single-focus charter corpus expanded from 6 to 7 foundational documents. Pillar inserted between §5.6 All Movers Accountability and §6 Cross-Cutting Commitments. |

| 2026-09-03 | ZQM Labs | tool | COLLABORATION_CONVENTIONS.md v1.0 (multi-writer protocol), Tools/collab/ claim.py + atomic_write.py, .gitignore hygiene, untracked generated artifacts | accepted | Alex Zelenski | Reduces read-modify-write collisions on shared drive; git documented as the structural fix. |
| 2026-09-03 | ZQM Labs | docs | ADR-005 GitHub profile structure; profile/README.md aligned to Project Volusia; honest badges in root README | accepted | Alex Zelenski | Live GitHub audit (ZQM-Labs + ZQM-Computing) confirmed single canonical repos; attestation repositioned as secondary workstream. |
| 2026-09-03 | ZQM Labs | docs | GitHub Pages site audit — es meta fixes (4 files), sitemap es URLs added; Pages-rebrand tracked as owner action (ADR-005 addendum) | accepted | Alex Zelenski | Site contradicts org profile (attestation landing vs Project Volusia focus); only mechanical fixes applied here; branding decision deferred to owner. |
| 2026-09-03 | ZQM Labs | tool | CI integrity: pyproject.toml (ruff scoped to owned paths + [project] for tests.yml), requirements-dev.txt, tests/test_portal.py (7 CI-safe tests); portal missing-DB 500 fix; format cleanup on owned files | accepted | Alex Zelenski | Verified: ruff check . + ruff format --check . pass at root; pytest 7/7 with DB and 7/7 with missing DB (simulated fresh checkout, no stray files). |
| 2026-09-03 | ZQM Labs | tool | Push-safety audit of all workflows: security-scan.yml fixed (org-license-free gitleaks container, permissions block, trivy pinned 0.28.0); supply-chain-scan.yml dispatch-only (scanner repo not public); committed API keys flagged for urgent rotation | accepted | Alex Zelenski | Two workflows were guaranteed-red on every push (gitleaks org license, 404 scanner download); keys committed in config.py/refresh_v2.py are exposed in the public repo — rotation is owner-blocking. |
| 2026-09-03 | ZQM Labs | tool | CI hotfix: security-scan.yml trivy-action ref corrected @0.28.0 → @v0.28.0 (trivy tags are v-prefixed; bad ref failed at "Set up job" in 5s). Caught via Actions jobs API after first real push; re-verified green on GitHub | accepted | Alex Zelenski | Lesson recorded: YAML validity ≠ ref validity — validate action refs against the registry before push. |
| 2026-09-03 | ZQM Labs | tool | P1-020 (folded): config.py whitespace reformat (1008aa1 tripped Format check); security-scan.yml permissions block restored after rewrite dropped it (CodeQL upload-sarif "Resource not accessible by integration", run 33772220066); upload-sarif v3→v4 | accepted | Alex Zelenski | Fixes restored into the writer's rewritten structure rather than reverting it. |
| 2026-09-03 | ZQM Labs | tool | P1-021 workflow debug, each fix citing the run that exposed it: gitleaks license-free container restored (gitleaks-action@v2 needs paid org license, run 33780238618); supply-chain-scan gated on scanner-repo HTTP probe + SARIF path fix (private repo 404, run 33780238547); volusia-pipeline GH_TOKEN instead of bash-redirect gh login on Windows, direct refresh_v2.py run, DB-push step disabled (gitignored artifact; races local writers, run 33780238631) | accepted | Alex Zelenski | gitleaks continue-on-error stays until committed API keys are rotated; DB stays out of git per P1-014 convention (artifact upload persists every refresh). |
| 2026-09-03 | ZQM Labs | tool | P1-022 gitignore `.pytest_cache/` (root pytest runs would otherwise leave untracked noise; dir currently holds no files). Also: audit confirmed `.env` (3 API keys), `claims/`, `.ruff_cache/` all untracked+ignored; live index.lock races with concurrent writer resolved by backoff-retry, no lock ever removed | accepted | Alex Zelenski | GitHub flagged 10 Dependabot vulnerabilities on ZQM-Labs mirror default branch (1 critical, 4 high) — owner to review the alerts page. |

## 4. AGENT CONTRIBUTIONS
